            <remarks>
            The event handlers should generally be fast and simple so that the thread can process all events that are raised
            by libuiohook. If you need to do a lot of processing in the event handlers then consider using another
            implementation, e.g. <see cref="T:SharpHook.TaskPoolGlobalHook" />.

            <remarks>
            The event handlers will run with the specified parallelism level on separate threads inside the default thread
            pool for tasks. This is done so that the hook itself will not be blocked if the handlers are long-running.
            The exception is the <see cref="E:SharpHook.IGlobalHook.HookDisabled" /> event which will run on the same thread that called
            the <see cref="M:System.IDisposable.Dispose" /> method since at that point it doesn't matter anymore that the hook is
            not blocked.
